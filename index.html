			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Welcome to my portfolio- I'm Andrew Frost and this website is a showcase of projects that I've worked on. Be sure to check the Projects page to see an overview, browse the source code, and play around with anything that catches your eye!</p>
			<p>I've always had an interest in video games, but I didn't decide to pursue them as a career path until a few years after high school. I first started programming in late 2012 by following some online JavaScript tutorials, and I liked it enough to pursue a degree in video game development. I began my studies at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi in Fall of 2013 where I was first introduced to C++ and had the opportunity to delve deeper into Computer Science. I acquired substantial experience in programming at college and would recommend it for most people interested in looking to expand their technological skills, but it's far from the only way to learn. I graduated Cum Laude and received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Game Programming in May of 2016.</p>
			<p>I love making programs that surprise people at how fast they work- there's something very satisfying about a tool that does its job spectacularly with no useless bloat.</p>
			<p>I'm currently aiming to move to Tokyo in the near future- if you're a hiring manager in the  area looking for a strong C++ or general programmer, I'd love to hear from you by email at <a href = "mailto:andrewdylanfrost@gmail.com">andrewdylanfrost@gmail.com</a>.</p>

								<p>A LeetCode problem where you are tasked with finding the shortest path through a grid starting at the top-left and working your way to the bottom-right with each movement costing varying amounts to complete. The full problem can be found <a href = "https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/description/">here</a>.</p>
								<p>My first solution was to always search the lowest available path until the bottom-right was reached, but the overhead in finding the lowest path was actually causing it to be slower than my final implementation that just broke it down into a few computationally easy steps:</p>
								<p>Conceptually, when the grid is finished, it will represent the shortest path to each individual square on the grid, which is obtained for each square by taking the lower of the potential adjacent origin grid squares plus the square's current value.</p>
								<p>We calculate the values for the first row and column, adding the current value of the square we are determining to the total value determined in the previous square, completing the shortest path to the outer top and left areas of the grid.</p>
								<p>Finally, we iteratively work through the remaining elements of the grid row by row, until we finally have the bottom-right square which is what we're after and return it.</p>
								<p>I love how clever this solution feels once you realize it can be done so simply.</p>

								<p>A LeetCode problem with the goal of rotating a linked list backward K times, with K potentially being fairly large. The full problem can be found <a href = "https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/description/">here</a>.</p>
								<p>First we establish the length of the linked list by iterating through it and keep a reference to the head and tail of the list, then check if we have at least two nodes and connect the head and tail to make the linked list into a circular linked list.</p>
								<p>Next, we want to determine what the new head and tail of the linked list will be. A surprisingly simple calculation can be done- subtract k modulus the total number of nodes from the total number of nodes (Nodes - (k % Nodes)) to get how many nodes forward from the original head we should traverse.</p>
								<p>We simple iterate through the list once again, stopping at the node just prior to what will be the new head. Set the next node to the head, and then set the current_Node's next connection to a null pointer and finally return the new head.</p>
								<p>I like how elegantly the solution came together, with only up to 2 loops through the list when a naïve approach could be a full k loops.</p>

								<p>A LeetCode problem in which we are tasked with finding whether a vector in which each value represents the max number of indexes forward you can traverse through the vector and must determine if the final entry is reachable. The full problem can be found <a href = "https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/">here</a>.</p>
								<p>First, we will reconceptualize the vector from being the number of jumps available at that space to be the furthest space that index is able to reach. To do so, we simple add the index to the value for each entry in the vector.</p>
								<p>Next, we will loop over the vector going to the available space that is able to travel the furthest each time we jump until we either reach the end or aren't able to make any progress on that jump and return true or false accordingly.</p>
